# Malaria-Cell-Classification-Project
## Task
TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google for the sole purpose of building and training machine learning models.
One of the datasets under the Tensorflow Image libraries is a malaria dataset which contains approximately 27,500 cell images of parasitized and uninfected cells from thin blood smear slide images of segmented cells.
 Using this dataset, we would like you to create a model which is able to classify whether a blood smear is uninfected or parasitized
